# workout-tracker
create a workout tracker. You have already been provided with the front end code in the `Develop` folder. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.  ## User Story  * As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.  ## Business Context  A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.  ## Acceptance Criteria  When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.  The user should be able to:    * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.    * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.    * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.    * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
