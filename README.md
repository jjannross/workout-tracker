# workout-tracker
Workout-tracker is an app that allows a user to create and track daily workouts. The user can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They are able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they are able to track the distance traveled. The user can also view a dashboard with all workouts from the last seven days summarized. Thereby, they are able to accomplish their fitness goals in a convienent and efficient manner. 

This app utilizes a Mondo database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with express.
